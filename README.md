MapMySnaps-React is a small React & Rails app that is a rebuilt version of another app with the [same name](http://machikoyasuda.github.io/hackforla-live/) that [Machiko](https://github.com/machikoyasuda) and I won third place for at Hack for LA.


Steps to run it locally:

1. Clone the repo.
2. In the search bar enter a city in California and it will return a list of retailers in that city that accepts SNAP benefits.
3. Continue reusing the app and searching for retailers in your area.
